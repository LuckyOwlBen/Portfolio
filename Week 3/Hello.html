                     We can fix anything. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. This is unplanned it really just happens.
                     I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Every day I learn. You need to have a very firm paint to do this.
                     A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Now then, let's play. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends.
                     You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Let's do it again then, what the heck. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.
